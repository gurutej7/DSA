/* 235. Lowest common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
{ https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/description/ }

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.
According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: â€œThe lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q 
as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.

        if(curr < p.val && curr < q.val) return lowestCommonAncestor(root.right,p,q);
