/* 621. Task Scheduler
{ https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/description/ } 

You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, and a cooling time, n. Each cycle or 
interval allows the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: identical tasks must be separated by at least n intervals due to cooling time.

â€‹Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.

Example 1:      Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
                Output: 8

Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.
After completing task A, you must wait two cycles before doing A again. The same applies to task B. In the 3rd 
interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle. By the 4th cycle, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.
